# BeaconReact #
A boiler-plate setup for leisure, included react-native-beacons-manager library in the project.... thats all! haha

Before you start, please ensure you have some basics of react-native, iOS and Android to help you with the development.

Please proceed to the official sites to read up more :)

## To start ## 
Ensure you have the necessaries installed

* React-Native
* NodeJS with NPM 
* Xcode/Android Studio setup
* Your favourite text/code editor, I recommend Visual Studio Code


You should be ready to use this boiler-plate project with a few steps

Just 
```
npm run init:lib
```
To install the necessary libraries required for the project

followed by:
```
react-native run-ios
or
react-native run-android
```
You should be able to run the project on simulator/emulator which might not be that useful, because you cannot detect bluetooth beacon in emulator

If you want to clean the library and re-install it again just
```
npm run reset:lib
```
